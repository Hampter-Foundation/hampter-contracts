## Makefile Commands

Here's a concise README paragraph for the Makefile, focusing on the available commands:

This Makefile simplifies the deployment of the HampterAuction smart contract using Hardhat Ignition. Available commands:

- `make deploy`: Deploys the contract to BuildBear network (override with `NETWORK=<network>`)
- `make clean`: Removes build artifacts
- `make help`: Displays available commands
  Use `make <command>` to execute. The Makefile streamlines deployment, reducing errors and improving workflow efficiency.
